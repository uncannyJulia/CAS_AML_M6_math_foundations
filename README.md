# CAS_AML_M6_math_foundations
My homework for CAS Advanced Machine Learning 2022/23 in Bern. Course M6 is about the mathematical foundations of Machine Learning. It was taught by Kinga. Task: develop your own neuronal network class.

All parts are numbered. The final Class can be found in the full_NN script. Apllications are all scripts entitled with the prefix application.

The solution is based on many tutorials, namely:
